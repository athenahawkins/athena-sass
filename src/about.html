        <h1>About the Band</h1>
        <h3>Harvey Dale</h3>
        <p>
          It was 2005. Harvey Dale brought his two best friends to his favorite bar in Austin and asked them to play a song with him. The rest is history. Harvey is the band's spokesperson, lead vocalist and resident word wizard. He writes songs and plays lead guitar.

        <h3>Athena Cement</h3>
        <p>
          Athena Cement is a drummer and soprano, rounding out Harvey's bright rasp with her soft vocals. She grew up singing musical theatre songs in the car, but she found her stride when she picked up a pair of drumsticks in college.

        <h3>Will Cement</h3>
        <p>
          Will Cement's first musical endeavor was in middle school band, where he played the Tuba. Now, he's the band's bassist. Occasionally, he jazzes up the scene with a keyboard riff. He's the resident jokester and you'll never catch him without a Dos Equis in hand.
